Moneywise is a personal finance manager that enables users to meet their financial objectives by understanding their spending habits through expense management. In Moneywise, users are able to view and filter their expenses and incomes by category, month, and dollar amount.  For the frequent traveler, there is an in- app currency converter API that updates daily with over 160 exchange rates. 

When users consistently track their spending, they know where their money goes and can better ensure that their money is used wisely. Tracking expenditures also allows users to understand their spending habits and make data supported decisions to identify and eliminate wasteful spending habits in their financial life. 

Features: 
- Users will be able to input their expenses and income, as well as make updates and delete entries. Entry details will include date, category, total amount, and a photo of the receipt.
- Users will create better financial habits by monitoring their transitions over a period of time and course-correct unnecessary expenses by creating new entries for their income and expenses 
- Users will better understand how much they are spending in certain categories, such as food, travel, and rent over a period of time. 
- Users traveling outside of the United States can use the currency conversion feature to easily convert their international expenses to USD.
